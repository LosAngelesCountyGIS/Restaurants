Tonight 🌝 🌌 was my very first time dining 🍽️ 😋 at Shiraz! And it was for my co-worker’s retirement party   
🎂 🎈🎊! It was a truly amazing 🤩, heartfelt    and fantastic event 💫😃! Other than the love ❤️, laughter 😂 and memories 
🧠 that my co-workers shared of our beloved co-worker    who officially retired today, the dinner dishes of fish 🐟, veggies 🥗, 
rice 🍚, and dessert 🍰 were absolutely delicious 😋! The room was perfectly set up with round tables so we could have lively 
conversations 💬 with our co-workers and also enjoy the wonderful slideshow 🎞️ in honor 🌟 of our retiring co-worker 🙂!

I have to admit that I don’t know what all of these dishes were called since I would have to ask my co-worker who organized this 
special event 🌟 🙂! But I would definitely ❤️ to come back for a meal 🥘 because the ambience was so nice ✨ and relaxing 😌! 
The waiters who served us were really courteous and friendly 🙂! And it also really helped that there is a huge parking lot 🚘 🅿️ 
in the back of the restaurant that is just for Shiraz customers 🙂! The best way to enter the parking lot is from Harvard Street, 
and it is located at the corner of Harvard Street and Glendale Blvd, right next to Palace Cleaners 👚 👕 👔 👖☺️!

Parking: Huge free parking lot 🅿️ in the back of the restaurant, just for Shiraz customers 😃! I was so grateful for this 😮‍💨😅, 
especially since it can be hard to find parking for certain places in the Glendale area 😳!
